DIY flex sensor using a LED, a LDR sensor and a plastic 
bendable tube covered in black tape. LED and the LDR are placed in each end of tube. When the tube 
is straight, light from LED reaches the LDR without any interference. When the tube is bended 
according to the degree, we bend the tube the amount of light reaching the LDR from LED changes 
accordingly.
